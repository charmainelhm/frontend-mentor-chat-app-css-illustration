- Used absolute positioning to determine the height of the background shapes
- Used transform property to rotate background shape

### Continued development

- Further readup on positioning and positioning
- Explore other ways of using the transform propety in CSS properties
- Animation of the different elements

### Useful resources

- [Setting Width and Height for Full Page Size](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-page-width-height/) - A good explanation of how percentage works and how the parent elements affect their child elements.

## Acknowledgments

Practice is a very important learning stage in coding, and I want to thank [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) for making it easier for me to do that. With their help, I can focus on understanding the different properties in HTML and CSS with my minimal knowledge on UI and UX design.
